08. PARTICLE NETWORK

particle systems, networks, processing, anar+, physics simulator

Particle Network sets up a system of random attractions between particles that repel one another. The result is a dynamic mesh that self-adjusts unitl it reaches a position of equilibrium. 


The Particle Network Script:	
After setting up the environment this script generates a point cloud of particles at random locations. Random spring connections between the particles pull the system together, while a repulsion force between each pair prevents the system from collapsing in on itself.
